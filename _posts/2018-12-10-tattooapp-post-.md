### Tattoodo 
This app could help both artist and clients if your looking for a shop near you are even 
just looking for a tattoo this app could help you. 

### For Artist 

When logging into the app it will ask you if you are an artist or basically a client. When choosing the artist version
it allows you to put a place where you work it also allows you to create an online portfolio for people to see. 


### For A Client 
It will show you any local studio near you and reviews on the place. It also explains the diifferent types of tattoos 
and what they are and any artist that tattoo in that type it will also show some photos of there work and some artisit even have a
"book now" which allows you to send an artist a email and allow you to get more information on the artist 

### What I think 
I would recommend this app because for me whos not really an actual artist I use this app to see the different artist near me and there kind of style they like to tattoo with. This app helps me follow my favorite artist like for example like Megan Massacre when looking at her page basically I can see where she works, her portfolio, and I could see the different styles she does, and I could even book her. Its kinda like a facebook but just for artist and their tattoos. Also in my opinion, if I was an artist I feel like this would be a great way to get my work out there and would help me to get clients
